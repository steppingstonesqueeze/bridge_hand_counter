# Bridge Hand Counter

An interactive Streamlit application for improving bridge hand counting skills through gamified practice. Players must quickly calculate missing suit distributions in bridge hands to develop mental arithmetic skills essential for competitive bridge play.

## Overview

This application helps bridge players develop rapid hand evaluation skills by presenting realistic bridge hands with one suit hidden. Players must calculate the missing suit's card count based on the constraint that every bridge hand contains exactly 13 cards.

## Features

### Interactive Gameplay
- **Timed Challenges**: Score based on both accuracy and speed
- **Realistic Hands**: Generates statistically valid bridge hand distributions
- **Visual Interface**: Clear suit symbols and intuitive card display
- **Progress Tracking**: Round-by-round scoring with statistics

### Customizable Sessions
- **Variable Game Length**: 1-50 rounds per session
- **Immediate Feedback**: Shows correct answers and complete hand breakdowns
- **Performance Metrics**: Total score, average score, and completion tracking

### Educational Design
- **Bridge Rules Integration**: Enforces the 13-card constraint fundamental to bridge
- **Mental Math Practice**: Develops quick subtraction and addition skills
- **Pattern Recognition**: Helps players recognize common hand distributions

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for interactive UI
- **Python Standard Library**: Random number generation and time tracking
- **Session State Management**: Maintains game state across interactions

### Game Logic
```python
def generate_hand():
    """Generate realistic bridge hand distributions"""
    # Randomly distributes 13 cards across 4 suits
    # Ensures mathematical validity of bridge constraints
```

### Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_score(time_taken):
    """Score = max(0, 100 - seconds_taken)"""
    # Rewards both accuracy and speed
    # Wrong answers receive 0 points
```

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
pip install streamlit
git clone https://github.com/steppingstonesqueeze/bridge_hand_counter
cd bridge_hand_counter
streamlit run bridge_game_streamlit.py
```

### Starting a Game
1. Set desired number of rounds (1-50)
2. Click "Start Game" to begin
3. Calculate missing suit count for each presented hand
4. Submit answers quickly for higher scores

### Gameplay Example
```
Current Hand:
♠ 4    ♥ 2    ♦ ?    ♣ 5

Answer: 13 - (4 + 2 + 5) = 2 diamonds
```
